Q1£º
1. Make a class "Flower"
2. Initialize each variable to an approprate value
3. Define methods for setting the value of each type
4. Define values of retrieving the value of each type
5. Use main function
6. Use try except to handle possible inappropriate inputs
7. Prompt up the user to enter the name of the flower, the number of petals, the price of the flower.
8. Show the user the flower name, the number of petals and the price.

Sample output:
Please enter the name of the flower:rose
Please enter the number of petals:10
Please enter the price of the flower:20
The flower name is rose
The number of petals is 10
The flower price is 20.0

Q2:
1. Write a class to conpute the derivative of each single term
2. Initialize the term of the polynomial
3. Locate the "^" sign of each term of the polynomial
(1) If can't find the "^" sign, then the term is constant
(2) If the term is "x" for example, then return 1
(3) If the term is "-x" for example, then return -1
(4) If the power is 1, then return the coeffiecient as the derivative
4. Save the chosen variable
5. Get the power of the term
6. Consider special situations: x^2, -x^2
7. Calculate the new effiecient
8. Return the result in appropriate form
9. Use the function to slice the whole polynomial to single terms
(1) Save the location of the "+/-" sign
(2) Avoid saving the first "+/-" sign repeatedly
(3) Sort the sign index in ascending order
10. Save all the single terms of the polynomial into one list
(1) If the polynomial only has two terms: get the terms before and after the sign
(2) If the polynomial has more than two terms: get the term before the first sign, after the last sign,
and between the first and last sign
11. Save derivative of all the terms ino one list, remove "0" terms
12. If the result starts with "+", eliminate it

Sample output:
Please input a polynomial in standard algebraic notation:5*x^3+4*x^2+5*x+7
The first derivative of the polynomial is 15*x^2+8*x+5

Please input a polynomial in standard algebraic notation:-x^3+7*x+9
The first derivative of the polynomial is -3*x^2+7

Please input a polynomial in standard algebraic notation:x^9+9*x^2+8
The first derivative of the polynomial is 9*x^8+18*x

Q3:
1. Import random and shuffle
2. Initialize different values
3. Append fish, bear and None to the river list
4. Randomize the elemnts of the river
5. Save the location of None element
6. Get a random move (left, right or stay still)
(1) Any animal can occupy a "None" location
(2) If two animals of same type collide, none of them disappear.
     Create a new instance of the type and place it in a random empty space
(3) If bear collides fish, then bear occupies fish's location and fish disappears
(4) If fish collides the bear, bear doesn't change, fish disappears
7. Save te animal location
8. In each simulation, the animal takes actions one by one
9. Print the result
10. Create an instance
11. Call main function

Sample output:
Please enter the initial value of the river length:20
Please enter the number of fishes:6
Please enter the number of bears:7
Please enter the number of steps of the random moving process:6
